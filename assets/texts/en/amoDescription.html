This is a (Firefox) add-on (WebExtension) that lets you invert the website's color scheme by inverting/changing the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme"><code style="font-family: Hack;">prefers-color-scheme</code></a> media feature of CSS without requiring you to chnage the whole system style setting.

This extension only works with modern Firefox v67 or higher, as this is the first version that supports this feature.

<b>Proof of concept!</b>
Note this is more or less only a proof-of-concept and may have flaws in real-world usage.
If you just want to have dark pages (with a light system style), it will mostly™ work fine, but everything else is hardly possible. Also there may be edge-cases, where things break. (Feel free to report bugs, anyway. It's good to know what/if websites break.)
For now, I do not really consider ever having a stable release of this add-on if Firefox does not get a proper API.
The technical story on why this is so hard to overwrite CSS like that in an add-on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/55910185/5008962">is described on Stackoverflow by me</a>, but basically I needed extract the CSS manually and manually apply it afterwards. And it requires an not-so-easy JS overwrite needed, too, BTW…
That's why I've requested a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1529323">better API on Bugzilla</a>. Unless this happens, this add-on will likely never be stable and always have some things break.

The code for this is <a href="https://github.com/rugk/website-dark-mode-switcher/">on GitHub</a>. Also report problems with websites there, please.
