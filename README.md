This is a (Firefox) add-on (WebExtension) that lets you invert the website's color scheme by inverting/changing the [`prefers-color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) media feature of CSS without requiring you to change the whole system style setting.

This extension only works with modern Firefox v67 or higher, as this is the first version that supports this feature.

## Important limitations!

Note this is quite restricted in real-world usage.
If you just want to have dark pages (with a light system style), it will usually work fine, but everything else is hardly possible. Also there may be edge-cases, where things break. (But please report bugs, anyway. It's good to know what/if websites break.)
To improve this situation Firefox would need to get a proper API.

The technical story on why this is so hard to overwrite CSS like that in an add-on [is described on Stackoverflow by me](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55910185/5008962), but basically I needed extract the CSS manually and manually apply it afterwards. And it requires an not-so-easy JS overwrite needed, too, BTW‚Ä¶

That's why I've requested a [better API on Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1547818) (feel free to upvote, if you want this, too!).

For this reason, the add-on is currently named ‚Äú**Dark Website Forcer**‚Äù. This makes it more obvious to the user, that it _cannot force_ a light website.
